    <h2>What I Have Done</h2> 
      <p>
   When I began my path through Software Engineering, I did not know a thing or two on how programing or coding works, let alone creating
   a website using java script. The assignments that were given when the semester started honestly made me worried due to how confused I 
   would get at even the simpliest of instructions. Even with websites such as Codeaccademy and w3schools, I would still struggle in 
   understanding how java script works. I would be lying if I didn't consider the possibility of wanting to change to a different 
   engineering major. However, I decided to keep on trying and to keep learning from the mistakes I had done with both labs and projects. 
   My instructor has helped me time and time again whenever I had an issue with either a question or something relating to my website; 
   it is this belief that has inspired me to go not only go through with this major, but to master it.

    <h3>Different Classes I Have</h3>
      <p>
   While this course is the main one needed for this kind of major, I am still taking differnt classes. I am actually taking both 
   statistcis and calculus at the same time, which helps to explain why I am sort of struggling with memorizing a lot of new material 
   from this class. I am also taking Humanities and Intro. to Literature, which both classes involve writing, and I mean a lot of
   writing. I am doing fairly well on all my classes, but I am going to have to study for many days in a row when it comes to the finals, 
   especially since I have both math finals on the same day, lucky me I guess.
