      <p>
    When I young, I have always been interested in learning how to proparly use technology, especially computers.
    Well mainly I would play flash games in differnet websites, but it still made me wonder how there were so many 
    different types of these games. I have always carried this type of curiosity to this day, and hopefully with this 
    class, I should be able to learn the processis done.

    <h3>My Progress as a Coder</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/marcosMachado4215698972" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mmachado9571" target="_blank">Github</a> has been really helpful in figuring out how to code.
